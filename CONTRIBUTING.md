## Coding Guidelines

-   **Always put in type hints whenever possible.** You may skip it if it can be inferred.
-   **Always format with black and isort**. This is to make all the style consistent within the project.
-   Whenever a list of arguments is too long in a single line, then use **one argument per line**. This ensures readability with the price of increased file size.
-   **Readability comes first**. If you feel like your code is not intuitive, then use comments!
